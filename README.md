# FirstAngularProject
This was my first angular application made with a course on Udemy.

This is the course - https://www.udemy.com/angular-4-front-to-back/ - made by Brad Traversy

To run the website run these in the CLI:

npm install           #Installs all the dependancies (You must have node package manager installed for this to work)

ng serve --open       #Compiles the code and opens index.html in the browser

(ctrl + c to end)
